## ENCODING ##
TODO think about an encoding scheme for the data
For variable encoding, we changed the values of the symbolic variables
to numerical values. The following is a list of the variables and the
encoding we used for each variable:
- State: we replaced the states with the latitude and longitude values
- GeneralHealth: we replace the values with numbers from 0 to 4, 4 being the best
- LastCheckupTime: we replace the values with numbers from 0 to 3, 0 being the best
- RemovedTeeth: we replace the values with numbers from 0 to 3, 0 being the best
- HadDiabetes: we replace the values with numbers from 0 to 3, 0 being the best
- SmokerStatus: we replace the values with numbers from 0 to 3, 0 being the best
- ECigaretteUsage: we replace the values with numbers from 0 to 3, 0 being the best
- RaceEthnicityCategory: we replace the values with numbers from 0 to 4, 0 being the best
- AgeCategory: we replace the age groupings with numbers from 0 to 12, 0 being the highest
- TetanusLast10Tdap: we replace the values with numbers from 0 to 3, 0 being the best
- AgeGroup: we replace the values with numbers from 0 to 3, 0 being the highest


## DATA MV INPUTATION ##
To deal with missing values, we used the following methods:
-   Frequent: replace missing values with the most frequent value of the variable
-   Mean: replace missing values with the mean of the variable
-   KNN: replace missing values with the mean of the K nearest neighbors
None of these methods performed significantly better than the others, so we
decided to use the knn method for the final model. Because its easy to apply when
the model is being used. And the performence was slightly better than the other
two methods. 
Results:
        frequent, knn, mean 
accuracy:  65 - 64 | 3 worse
recall:    41 - 42 | 3 better
precision: 40 -  - | -
auc:       58 -  - | -
f1:        40 41 - | 1 worse

accuracy:  61 62 61| 2 better
recall:    34 -  - | -
precision: 33 34 - | 1 worse
auc:       53 -  - | -
f1:        33 34 - | 1 worse

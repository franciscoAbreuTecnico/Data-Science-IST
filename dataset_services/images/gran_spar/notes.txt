Column Credit_History_Age was converted from symbolic to numerical.
Column Payment_Behaviour was split into Payment_Behaviour_Spend and Payment_Behaviour_Value since analysing Payment_Behaviour gave no real insight.
Most of obvious erroneous input values were removed from columns and replaced with NaN.
In the Sparsity analysis, column "Type_of_Loan" was encoded into numerical values to allow for the final figure generation (there are over 6000 different combinations in this column, forcing too much of a load onto the pyplot functions).

This was the mapping for the new "JobType" column in the granularity analysis:
